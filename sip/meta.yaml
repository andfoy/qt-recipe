  summary: 'A Python bindings generator for C/C++ libraries'
  description: |
    SIP is a collection of tools that makes it very easy to create Python
    bindings for C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed in 1998
    to create PyQt, the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be
    used to create bindings for any C or C++ library. For example it is
    also used to generate wxPython, the Python bindings for wxWidgets.
